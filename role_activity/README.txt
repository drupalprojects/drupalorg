This module is for logging certain actions for certain roles on a busy
site. It is useful to see how active moderators are for example.

Note that for Drupal 5.10, this module requires the hook_watchdog() backport
patch in http://drupal.org/node/149341#comment-934842 (not the later
patches).

No patching needed for Drupal 6.x
